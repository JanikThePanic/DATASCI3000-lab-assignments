    "As modern vehicles have lots of connectivity, protecting in-vehicle network from cyber-attacks is an important issue. Controller Area Network (CAN) is the standard protocol for the in-vehicle network. But, the lack of security features in the CAN protocol makes vehicles vulnerable to attacks. The message injection attack is a representative attack type which injects fabricated messages to deceive electronic control unit (ECUs) or cause malfunctions. Through this notebook, you will develop ML modeles to detect different types of CAN attacks and protect vehicle networks. \n",

The dataset includes over 10,000 records and 10 attributes (including the target variable \"Label\").\n",
